        <h2>Sample Stories</h2>
        <div class="separator"></div>

<p>Here are three examples of story briefs to help you think about what might be applicable to your issue and how you might frame it. Again - if you have an idea, submit the highlights, and we'll contact you to chat more.</p>


<h2>Fairer and better Justice</h2>
<h3>What's your issue?:</h3>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Shift the conversation around justice away from <strong>"tough on crime"</strong> to ______ (that's your job!)</p>

<h3>In detail:</h3>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Studies and stats on justice are unequivocal - the criminal/jail system in the US doesn't do what it's meant to - it doesn't deter potential criminals, it doesn't make victims feel better, and it doesn't reform those convicted, it hardens them.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">So we have a system that's screwed up -  it makes us citizens less safe and it magnifies what might have simply been a mistake in a young person's life and it streams them into a life of crime.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">So why does it persist?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Because we're hardwired to feel "an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth".</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">That's why Tough On Crime initiatives are popular. It's instinctive to want to punish people in proportion to the harm they caused.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Yet new work on Restorative Justice is turning this on its head. It's counter-intuitive, but it has been proven to work. Bring victims and perpetrators together, allow both to hear the other's story. And only then allow a sentence - a punishment - to be proscribed - taking into account what victims suggest. When victims hear the perpetrator say "I'm sorry", that helps them heal more than seeing them punished. When perpetrators come face to face with the pain they create, that's crucial for reform. And a sentence that comes out of this process can be creative, and also keep society safe.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Yet no one can stand up in America today and advocate for this. You'd be labelled a weak liberal.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">So how can we change the conversation?</p>

<h3>Who needs to hear about it?</h3>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">We'll start with the general public, but probably a subset of law-enforcement people would be the ones starting to implement these ideas. A group of (tough) victims willing to advocate for changes to the system would be powerful.</p>

<h3><strong>Some Ideas/hooks</strong>:</h3>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Targeting specific crimes/circumstance as a wedge/proof of concept; changing the name "restorative justice"; finding unexpected allies (tough-ass texan), finding unexpected spokespeople (victims of violent crimes for restorative justice).</p>

<h3>Person or Organization proposing issue:</h3>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Sample idea</p>

<h3>Back up information and studies, leading implementing organisations, potential allies:</h3>
